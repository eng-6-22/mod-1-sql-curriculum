    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this lab we will practice using aggregate SQL functions. These functions, such as AVG, MIN, and MAX, allow us to perform mathematical operations on a set of numbers, and return one value. We will also use the GROUP BY function. GROUP BY allows us to group rows that have identical values in a column (or columns), often with the intention of performing an aggregate function on these groups. In the database we are using in this lab, each row represents a school, with each column representing some metric or information about that school. We could use an aggregate function to find the MAX total students of all the schools listed. But what if we wanted to know the MAX number of students by Boro? Previously we might have used a WHERE clause, but that would require a separate statement for each boro. Thats where GROUP BY clauses come in. In this example we could use GROUP BY boro, and the query would return the results of our aggregate function for each boro."
